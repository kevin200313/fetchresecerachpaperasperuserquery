With the affordances currently provided by artificial intelligence and machine learning to process textual data for meaning, our interdisciplinary team of computer and social science researchers is using a data set of open-ended text responses to test procedures for creating thematic categories to organize participant responses by content. By comparing parallel analyses of our text corpus using traditional and NLP thematic-analysis techniques, we identify key areas of congruity and incongruity between human analysts and NLP algorithms. While the areas of congruity point to the potential usefulness of NLP systems in qualitative research, the areas of incongruity suggest the need for a “human in the loop” NLP platform which iteratively refines the content analysis outputs based on feedback from an expert researcher until a satisfactorily coherent thematic description is achieved.",

        "abstract": "Natural language processing (NLP) have been recently used to extract clinical information from free text in Electronic Health Record (EHR). In clinical NLP one challenge is that the meaning of clinical entities is heavily affected by assertion modifiers such as negation, uncertain, hypothetical, experiencer and so on. Incorrect assertion assignment could cause inaccurate diagnosis of patients' condition or negatively influence following study like disease modeling. Thus, clinical NLP systems which can detect assertion status of given target medical findings (e.g. disease, symptom) in clinical context are highly demanded. Here in this work, we propose a deep-learning system based on word embedding, RNN and attention mechanism (more specifically: Attention-based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks) for assertion detection in clinical notes. Unlike previous state-of-art methods which require knowledge input or feature engineering, our system is a knowledge poor machine learning system and can be easily extended or transferred to other domains. The evaluation of our system on public benchmarking corpora demonstrates that a knowledge poor deep-learning system can also achieve high performance for detecting negation and assertions comparing to state-of-the-art systems.",

        "abstract": "With internet and social media breaking the ice, more and more people across the globe have started to use social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc. Most people follow Multilingualism as a mode of communication to convey information across the globe. They share topics over the common forum to converse, with the use of multiple languages being spoken either by individual speaker or group of speakers. This essentially makes the context more complex to understand and it makes even more harder for processing various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Such user behavior of mixing multiple languages in one single discussion topic, having multiple community inclusion is referred as code-switching. At IEEE 2019 Big data conference, a Shared Task (Understanding Multilingual Communities through Analysis of code-switching Behaviors in Social Media Discussions) is conducted as a track of Big Data Cup. Firstly, Tasks is to detect the language of each post given in the discussion forum with the help of multiple languages. Secondly, to detect relevance score of a post by determining how much the content is closely connected or appropriate in the discussion. This paper proposes a novel approach to detect the language of each word in the post using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques involving linguistics, Python package(langdetect) and various other approaches. It also explains how Machine Learning is applied to figure out relevance of a post and other metrics required for prediction. Code-Mixing detection is an important step for any NLP application to determine the language of a post at first place in order to perform any NLP task over social media.",

The proposed procedure allows to extract information related to the candidates' work experience and education from their CVs which come in pdf or docx format. In particular, CV segmentation into 3 blocks (Basic Information, Education and Work Experience) is performed.",

The paper describes various statistical models proposed and the limitations incurred in the same due to limited intelligence of a machine. We have discussed different neural networks highlighting the importance of Convolutional Neural Networking. We have discussed about open source software TensorFlow that works on Deep learning and the edge it has over the conventional models. Also we have recommended Reinforcement learning as an extension to neural networking which is widely used in gaming for the purpose of Natural Language Processing. We can utilize the reward-driven algorithm for better results.",

We present an approach which uses natural language processing techniques to analyze text and detect inappropriate statements which are indicative of phishing attacks. Our approach is novel compared to previous work because it focuses on the natural language text contained in the attack, performing semantic analysis of the text to detect malicious intent. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we have evaluated it using a large benchmark set of phishing emails.",

This paper briefly describes a method of encoding character sequences, which is inspired by biological memory systems. The algorithm can be thought of as a type of artificial neural network, which is only used to store text data in a specific way, not generate predictions. To test the viability of the approach, the task of searching for words in a dictionary was used, utilizing two simple heuristic rules. The goal is to produce tools capable of cleaning texts written in any language, which uses a phonemic writing system. Texts written in two specific languages are being processed during development and experimentation, they are English and Bulgarian. User-friendliness and minimization of data obfuscation are the driving requirements. Another requirement is compatibility with other machine learning methods, since the algorithm is not intended for solving an entire NLP case from start to finish. It is to be used only during the data preparation phase.",

This classification facilitates proper analysis of security requirements so that adequate security mechanisms are incorporated in the development process. Machine Learning techniques have been used in Security Requirements classification to aid in the process that lead to ensuring that correct security mechanisms are designed corresponding to the Security Requirements classifications made to eliminate the risk of security being incorporated in the late stages of development. However, these Machine Learning techniques have been found to have problems including, handcrafting of features, overfitting and failure to perform well with high dimensional data. In this paper we explore Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning to determine if this can be applied to Security Requirements classification.",

Many natural language processing (NLP) applications could benefit from a richer model of text meaning than the bag-of-words and n-gram models that currently predominate. Despite theoretical interest since the 1960s, however, no large-scale model exists; in fact, it is not even clear what such a model should minimally include. However, the introduction of large-scale public resources such as the Penn TreeBank and WordNet have generated a great deal of progress in the NLP community, and so it seems increasingly important to create some kind of meaning-oriented model and build a corresponding corpus that is large enough to support adequate machine learning. This talk argues for the necessity of (even shallow) semantics-based NLP, describes the contents and operation of the OntoNotes project, and in so doing introduces and explains the general issues facing annotation projects. Our hope is that other people not only try to use the OntoNotes corpus in their own work, but also create their own annotations on the same material, so that more layers of shallow semantics can be included into OntoNotes.",

An accurate POS tagger is essential for many NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, dependency parsing, etc. This research work proposes a deep learning model and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) model to perform POS tagging for Marathi text. We achieved an accuracy of 85% for the deep learning model and 97% for the Bi-LSTM model. Our contribution here is based on three folds - building a deep learning model, building the Bi-LSTM model, comparison with machine learning techniques for the same dataset.",

In this paper, we propose CNN model of stock price prediction using Korean natural language processing. In the case of Korean natural language processing research was not actively performed compared to English language. We converted Korean sentences into nouns and vectorized them using skip-grams to extract the characteristics of the words. Then, the vectorized word sentence was used as input data of the CNN model to predict the stock price after 5 days of trading day. Most models have more than 50% prediction accuracy for stock price up and down. The highest accuracy of the model was about 53%. Since the result is not considerable but meaningful, it shows the possibility of developing the stock price prediction model through Korean natural language processing in the future.",

Currently the discovery process lacks of well-defined semantics, therefore it is difficult to obtain the non explicit meaning of services, such as functionality. In order to provide an accurate solution to the problem described above, in this paper we evaluate two natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract semantic information from textual descriptions of Web services: linguistic patterns and extraction rules. Both techniques are implemented and compared in order to select the best alternative to our problem. This information will be useful for enhancing semantically the discovery process of services. We implemented a simulation environment for experimentation, and designed a set of experiments to show the applicability of our solution approach. Results of the tests show that the linguistic patterns are better than extraction rules.",

In this paper, we summarize and classify some common the system of service, explain their principles, differentiate their advantages and disadvantages, summarize their need and the framework. On this basis, we design an intelligent assistant teaching system which uses natural language processing technology as developing-designing tool. Based on deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) technology, this intelligent assistant teaching system is built for on-line learning platforms, which is the first application of intelligent customer service on on-line learning platforms. It can provide timely feedback for learners and improve their enthusiasm for learning.",

        "abstract": "The paper presents research outcomes of classifying music into moods and provides an end-to-end, open source pipeline for mood classification using lyrics. It explores techniques that classify music using audio features and lyrics using various natural language processing methods and machine learning. The paper performs a comparative study across different classification models and mood frameworks. The linguistic aspects of lyrics are explored and are used as features for classification methods to understand what model classifies mood in the most adequate manner. The results show how lyrics are a valuable information source for classification of music. Term-frequency/inverse-document frequency and word embeddings are explored to connect words to mood classes. Various machine learning and deep learning classifiers are tested across different arrangements of the mood labels. The paper demonstrates that models which learn from lyrics using current methods of natural language processing using deep learning demonstrate higher levels of accuracy. Our final model achieves an accuracy of 71%.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, there are many tools and applications available that use novel machine learning algorithms, but only few tools exist that bridge the gap between the computer scientists and general public. The latter especially holds for the field of natural language processing. Therefore in this paper we present a new information extraction toolkit, called nutIE, that offers a frontend for end-to-end text analysis using a modern javascript-based web application. The core of the toolkit includes all the high-level information extraction techniques with supporting preprocessing and evaluation methods. All these can be accessed by a Scala programmatic API or an arbitrary third-party application via REST interface. It has already been shown that the integrated toolkit's algorithms achieve state-of-the art results. The toolkit is currently applied at international text processing projects and courses.",

        "abstract": "Text mining, also referred to as text data mining, is the process of extracting interesting and non-trivial patterns or knowledge from text documents. It uses algorithms to transform free flow text (unstructured) into data that can be analyzed (structured) by applying Statistical, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Text mining is an evolving technology that allows enterprises to understand their customers well, and help them in redefining customer needs. As e-commerce is becoming more and more established, the number of customer reviews and feedback that a product receives has grown rapidly over a period of time. For a popular asset, the number of review comments can be in thousands or even more. This makes it difficult for the manufacturer to read all of them to make an informed decision in improving product quality and support. Again it is difficult for the manufacturer to keep track and to manage all customer opinions. This article attempts to derive some meaningful information from asset reviews which will be used in enhancing asset features from engineering point of view and helps in improving the support quality and customer experience.",

It is a tedious task to manually read the entire book and classify it based on its genre. Novice writers find it troublesome to figure out the genre of their book, which can affect its reach to the right audience. The proposed method gains knowledge from a large number of words from the books and transforms them into a feature matrix. During transformation, the size of the initial matrix is reduced using Wordnet and Principle Component Analysis. Then, AdaBoost classifier is applied to predict the genres of the books.",

The clickbait messages often adopt eye-catching on wording, lagging of information on a content to attract visitors. We contribute the clickbait corpus by crowdsourcing, 30,000 of headlines are selected to draw up the dataset. In this work attempt to develop clickbait detection model using two type of features in the embedding layer and three different of networks in the hidden layer. BiLSTM with word level embedding performs very well achieving accuracy rate of 0.98, fl-score of 0.98.",

Artificial Intelligence is the backbone for development of intelligent machines which use natural language processing and deep learning as fundamental tools. In this paper, we present the new perspective of intelligent machines in everyday usage, along with the importance of understanding the natural language and generating machine level natural language for intelligent machines. Further, we summarize an overview of deep learning concurrent neural network and recurrent neural network models. Also, we review the significance of sentimental analysis using natural language processing and the ability of machines to take decisions and solve problems.",
